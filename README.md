# K-Means Image Segmentation from First Principles

## Project Description
This repository features a ground-up implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm applied to computer vision. By treating each pixel in an RGB color space as a 3D coordinate, the model performs unsupervised segmentation to extract meaningful regions and compress color information.

## Technical Methodology
- **Vectorized Euclidean Distance:** Calculated distances across the entire image tensor using NumPy broadcasting for high computational efficiency.
- **Centroid Optimization:** Iterative refinement of cluster centers to minimize the objective function ($J$).
- **Color Quantization:** Mapping high-resolution color depth to $K$ dominant centroids, demonstrating a fundamental technique in image compression.

## Visual Results
The repository includes `input_image.jpg` and the corresponding segmentation masks generated by the algorithm, showcasing the extraction of foreground elements from complex backgrounds.

## Structure
- `Image_Segmentation_KMeans_Scratch.ipynb`: The core implementation.
- `matryoshka.jpg`: The raw data used for the segmentation case study.
